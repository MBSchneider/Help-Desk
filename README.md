## Description
I created this **Help Desk** application to experiment with ActionMailer.  This application allows you to create a *ticket* with a description.  Once the *ticket* is created, an email is automatically sent to me.  When I respond to the message, my email response is posted as an answer to the ticket.  This is handled by [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/).
